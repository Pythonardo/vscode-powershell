## Learning Objectives

* VSCode is a cross-platform editor, which provides a consistent experience across operating systems
  * VSCode is built on the [cross-platform Electron.js UI framework](https://www.electronjs.org/)
* PowerShell has been cross-platform since 2016 (MacOS, Linux, Windows, x86/ARM)
* PowerShell extension works on VSCode and provides synax highlighting, debugging, a PowerShell terminal

### PowerShell ISE

* The traditional method of developing PowerShell scripts was to use PowerShell Integrated Scripting Editor (ISE)
* Limitations of PowerShell ISE:
  * No project management
  * UI does not scale well
  * Not extensible (kinda with ISE add-ons)
  * Not theme-able
  * Limited keyboard navigation
  * No universal project search

### Why Use VSCode Then?

* **Project Management** - VSCode enables you to open an entire directory as a workspace, and open multiple workspaces simultaneously.
* **UI Scaling** - VSCode UI scales along with the code itself
* **Extensibility** - VSCode is extensible using a JavaScript / TypeScript API, which can be distributed via the Marketplace
* **Themes** - VSCode Marketplace has tons of themes (which are just extensions)
* **Keyboard Navigation** - VSCode centers around keyboard navigation, thanks to the searchable Command Palette
* **Search** - You can search through your entire code repository with a single operation
