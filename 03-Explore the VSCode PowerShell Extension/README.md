## Learning Objectives

* For each file you open in Visual Studio Code, you can select a language mode. 
* The selected language mode affects syntax highlighting and activates language-specific functionality such as debugging and Intellisense.
* Open the Command Palette with `F1` or `CTRL + SHIFT + P`
* The Intellisense integration can frequently get hung up, so use the `PowerShell: Restart Current Session` to kick it back into gear
* Focus Console on Execute with `F8` key
* Custom themes for Visual Studio Code can help liven up your development environment
* **Command Explorer**
